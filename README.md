# NJiT-DFIR-Project
Final project for NJiT DFIR class showcasing a CTF using three seperate VMs. SIFT , Victim VM and a "diagnostic" VM. Wireshark was used for PCAP investigation. SIFT used for zeek and malware investigation. Finding backdoor using autoruns. Inspecting regedit for added "$" users. Download and use mimikatz to extract NTFS hash of the $hidden user. The $hidden user used the same password for an encrypted file which was in the documents folder. HxD was used to edit the file due to .rar intentionally being mispelled to the file could not be opened. After renaming the file correcly in hxd, same NTFS password was input to reveal the CTF picture.
